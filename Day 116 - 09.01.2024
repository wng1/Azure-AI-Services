Data Engineers primary role responsible for:

- Integrating
- Transforming
- And Consolidating Data

from various structured and unstructured data systems into structures that are suitable for building analytics solutions.

An Azure Data Engineer also helps ensure that:
(1) data pipelines and 
(2) data stores are: 

- high-performing
- efficient, 
- organized, and 
- reliable, 

given a specific set of business requirements and constraints.

1) Structured Data - Tables/Schemas/CSV/flat file etc
2) Semi-Structured - JSON
3) Unstructred data - Key-Vale pairs, PDF, documents and images

========================================================================================================================================
Data Integration - creating/establishing links between operational and analytical services and data sources to enable:

- secure
- reliable

access to data across multiple systems.  For example, a business process might rely on data that is spread across multiple systems,
and a data engineeer is required to establish links so that the required data can be extracted from all of these systems.
========================================================================================================================================
Data Transformation - Operational data usually needs to be transformed into suitable structure and format for analysis, often
as part of an ETL, the data is used to quickly ingest the data intot he data lake, and then apply "big data" processing techniques to transform it.

Regardless of the approach used, the data is prepared to support downstream analytical needs.

========================================================================================================================================
Data Consolidation - is a process of combining data that has been extracted from multiple data soures into a consistent strucutre - usually to support
analytics and reporting.

Commonly, data from operational systems is extracted, transformed, and loaded into analytical stores such as a data lake or data warehouse.

========================================================================================================================================


1) Operational and Analytical Data
Operational Data is usually transactional data that is generated and stored by applications, often in a relational or non-relational database.
Analytical data is data that has been optimized for analysis and reporting, often in a data warehouse.

One of the core responsibilities of data engineer is to:

- Design
- Implement
- Manage Solutions

that integrate operational and analytical data sources or extract operational data from multiple systems, transform it to appropriate structures
for analytics, and load it into an analytical data store (usually referred to as ETL solutions).

2) Streaming Data
It is a perpetual sources of data that generate data values in real-time, oftening relating to specific events.
Common sources of streaming data includes IOT devices and social media feeds.

Data Engineers often need to implement solutions that capture real-time stream of data and ingest them into analytical data systems, often
combining the real-time data with other application data that is processed in batches.

3) Data Pipelines
It is used to orchestra activities that transfer and transform data. Pipelines are the primary way in which data engineers implement repeatable extract, transform and load
(ETL) solutions that can be triggered based on schedule or in response to events.

4) Data Lakes
It is a storage repository that holds large amount of data in native, raw formats. Data lake stores are optimized for scaling to massive volumes(terabytes or petabytes)
of data. The data typically comes from multiple heterogenous sources, and may be structured, semi-structured or unstructured.

The idea with a data lake is to store everything in it original, untransformed state. This approach differs from a traditional data warehouse, which transforms and 
processes the data at the time of ingestion.

5) Data warehouse
It is a centralised repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. Data warehouses store current and historical data in relational tables that
are orgnized into a schema that optimizes performance for analytical queries. 

Data engineers are responsible for designing and implementing relational data warehouses, and managing regular data loads into tables.
