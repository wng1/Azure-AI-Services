Data Analytics solutions often include a requirement to ingest and process streams of data.

Stream processing differs from batch processing in that streams are generally boundless - in other words,
they are continuous sources of data that must be processed perpetually rather than at fixed intervals.

Azure Stream Analytics provides a cloud service that you can use to define a query that operates on a stream
of data from a streamiong source, such as Azure Event Hubs or an Azure IoT Hub.
