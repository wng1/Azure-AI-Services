Data Analytics solutions often include a requirement to ingest and process streams of data.

Stream processing differs from batch processing in that streams are generally boundless - in other words,
they are continuous sources of data that must be processed perpetually rather than at fixed intervals.

Azure Stream Analytics provides a cloud service that you can use to define a query that operates on a stream
of data from a streamiong source, such as Azure Event Hubs or an Azure IoT Hub.

You can use an Azure Stream Analytics query to process a stream of data and send the results directly to Power BI
for real-time visualisation.

1) Use Azure Streams Analytics to process a stream of sales order data
2) Order data will be sent from Azure Event Hubs, from where your Azure Stream Analytics job will read and summarize the 
data before sending it to Power Bi, where you will visualize the data in a report.


Stream Analytics workspace
Stream Analytics job
Input into the Stream Analytics (Event Data Stream) so Azure Event Hub
Output to Power BI workspace

Create a query to summarize the event stream
SELECT
	DataAdd(second, -5, System.TimeStamp) AS StartTime,
	System.TimeStamp AS EndTime,
	ProductID,
	SUM(Quantity) AS Orders
INTO
	[powerbi-dataset]
FROM
  [orders] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime
GROUP BY ProductID, TumblingWindow(second, 5)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
