Before migrating, it is important to assess to:

1) identify (any compatabilitiy issues or potential blockers) that may prevent a successful migration.

Steps
Any issues/breaks that may require post-migration fixes.

2) Learn various (tools and options) available for assessing and migrating SQL server databases to Azure SQL.

Steps
There are migration tools that can help identify issues/breaking changes, behaviour changes, deprecated features. These can be used to
check against a migration target, as it allows you to quickly assess a database to see the impact of migrating without any initial setup or licensing cost.

- Understand the assessment rules used in the migration process is important
- Why? It allows you to (identify and address potential issues or challenges before migrating) your SQL server database to Azure SQL database.

Example
- LinkedServer rule - is one of the rules in the assessment guidelines for migrating your SQL server DB to Azure SQL 
(This rule checks for the prescence of linked servers, which aren't supported in Azure SQL database)




3) Use Azure Migration extension on (Azure Data Studio) to assess SQL Server databases
4) Use (Azure Migrate) to assess SQL server databases
5) Use (Data Migration Assistant) DMA to assess SQL server databases.


Companies like to standardize and modernise their data estate but they don't know how much administrative and development effort it requires.

Therefore the main responsiblity of a Senior Data Administrator is to identify what is needed and ultimately migrate several SQL server databases from 
on-premises servers to Azure with as minimum disruption as possible.
