Microsoft Power BI is used to create:

1) dynamic
2) interactive data visualisations

that reveals insight on which important business decisions are based. 

Access to timely data can be the difference between failure and success, so the ability to capture and visualise data in real-time, or as near as possible,
is critical in many scenarios.

Azure Stream Analytics provides a way to process a stream of real-time data from an input such as:

1) Azure Event Hubs

and direct the results to an output. And one possible output is a Power BI dataset, from which
dashboards can consume data for real-time visualization.
