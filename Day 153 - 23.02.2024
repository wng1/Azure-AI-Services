PIVOT AND UNPIVOT

SQL windowing operations allow you:
to define a subset of rows from a result set and apply functions against those rows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Window functions allow you to perform operations such as assign a rank order to a row or divide a result set into different parts.
OVER
RANK
AGGREGRATE
OFFSET
Windowing functions allows you to RANK, AGGREGRATE, OFFSET, OVER
Windowing requires a set of rows to work on. The OVER clause is used to define the window you want to work on. You can then use a window function on the subset of rows you have defined.
Windows also provide an efficient way to compare values in oen row with values in another without needing to join a table to itself.

Windows and Window functions provide functionality that is difficult to replicate with other SQL commands.

OVER clause can use:
PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, ROWS/RANGE

Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
Ranking functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, NTILE)
Analytic functions (CUME_DIST, PERCENTILE_CONT, PERCENTILE_DISC)
Offset functions (LAG, LEAD, LAST_VALUE)
