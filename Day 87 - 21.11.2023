Azure Synapse Analytics

Azure Synapse Analytics is a cloud-based Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) that takes advantage of Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to quickly run complex queries across large amount of data. It's a distributed system designed to provide analytics on large data. Migrating to Azure Synapse Analytics requires some design changes to table schemas and code that aren't difficult to understand but might take some time to implement. If your business requires an enterprise-class data warehouse, the benefits are worth the effort. However, if you don't need the power of Azure Synapse Analytics, it will be more cost-effective to use Azure SQL Database or SQL Server on Virtual Machine.

Consider using Azure Synapse Analytics when you:

    Have one or more terabytes of data
    Plan to run analytics on large amounts of data
    Need the ability to scale compute and storage
    Want to save on costs by pausing compute resources when you don't need them.

Don't use Azure Synapse Analytics when your workloads have:

    High frequency reads and writes
    Large numbers of singleton select statements
    High volumes of single row inserts
    Row-by-row processing needs
    Incompatible formats (JSON, XML)
